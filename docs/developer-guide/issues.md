# Issues

We use GitHub issues for managing [bugs](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/bug), 
[ideas](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/idea),
and [todos](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/todo).
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) / [easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy) can be good (first) contributions.
Reach out if you're unsure, or would like to work on something else.
 
### Upcoming Features and Improvements ###

Our [public roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress,
what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.

You are welcome to submit specific feature requests via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues)
if you have verified that no similar [idea](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/idea) or
[todo](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/todo) already exists. Give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  ,
so that we know what is most popular.

    Our vision is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible.

### How to Write User Stories ###

Start describing new ideas and tasks with a [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) similar to this one:

<tt>As a [type of person] I'd like to be able to [do something] so that I can [get some result].</tt>

This makes it easier for everyone to understand who wants what and why. Reading between the lines can otherwise cost a
lot of time. It becomes even more expensive when the wrong things are implemented, or they don't bring any benefit.

### Acceptance Criteria ###

Issues should include a list of *Acceptance Criteria* that clearly specify when a story is ready to be implemented
and then finally tested. We recommend using MAY, SHOULD, and MUST as keywords to indicate priorities.

Clickable [checkboxes](https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/) for each item can be created via
[GitHub Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

```
Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] "Log In" button MUST be visible on /login page
- [ ] "Log In" button MAY be disabled if password field is empty
- [ ] Page SHOULD use existing Vuetify components
- [ ] Login MUST work in latest Firefox, Safari and Chrome
```

### Effectiveness > Efficiency ###

!!! note ""
    It is fundamentally the confusion between effectiveness and efficiency that stands between doing the right things and doing things right. There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all. ‚Äî <cite>[Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker)</cite>

!!! note ""
    Optimize for effectiveness before efficiency. Optimize for value before cost. ‚Äî <cite>[Sam Briesemeister](https://twitter.com/systemalias/status/1480987512004919302)</cite>

and consistent use of community feedback. Please [share your experiences](../contact.md) with us, in particular if you have

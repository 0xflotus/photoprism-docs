Our frontend code is structured into reusable VueJS components. So far, it was clear enough for developers to add features and send pull requests, so it's probably not necessary to document individual components in our Developer Guide. Let us know via email or chat when you have any questions!

[Frontend](introduction.md) contains general information about the front-end libraries we use and how to trigger a build.

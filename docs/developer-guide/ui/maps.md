# Rendering Interactive Maps in the UI

Because Mapbox GL JS is [no longer open-source](https://wptavern.com/mapbox-gl-js-is-no-longer-open-source),
we now [sponsor](https://github.com/orgs/photoprism/sponsoring) and use [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js)
for rendering maps in the UI. MapLibre GL is a fork from the [last version](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/tree/v1.13.2)
available under a permissive BSD license.

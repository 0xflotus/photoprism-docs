# Thumbnail Images

PhotoPrism uses the [disintegration/imaging](https://github.com/disintegration/imaging) package to generate thumbnail
images that are displayed in search results and in the full-screen viewer.

The smallest configurable size limit for thumbnails is 720px, which corresponds to the `fit_720` image type.
All sizes up to 720x720 will be generated by default and should therefore always be available.
Besides their obvious use in the frontend, the indexer uses them for color detection, face detection and
image classification. See also [Advanced Settings](../../user-guide/settings/advanced.md) in the [User Guide](../../user-guide/index.md).

## Server API ##

### Why Not Use Cookies? ###

Avoiding cookies helps minimize request latency by eliminating network traffic:

- when a browser requests static files such as images from a server via HTTPS, it is generally unnecessary to send a
  cookie along with each request if the URLs cannot be guessed realistically - that is, for most practical use cases
- one potential use of cookies might be to prevent the user from intentionally or accidentally sharing cryptic thumbnail URLs with others
- however, this is possible with most real-world image hosting services and could also be considered a feature if you only want to share specific thumbnails without overhead

An additional advantage of this approach is that users can easily integrate a content delivery network (CDN),
as there are no secrets to share and no cookies to check.

Because most users have only one domain/host name and modern Web apps can store authentication tokens in *localStorage*
instead, we have decided not use any cookies by default.

### Image URIs ####

Authenticated with SHA1 hash and additional security token:

```
/api/v1/t/a2195b6840f46b555719d8e22e9b080e61a7317c/10d68214/tile_500
```

In public mode without security token:

```
/api/v1/t/a2195b6840f46b555719d8e22e9b080e61a7317c/public/tile_500
```

The thumbnail [size and aspect ratio](#image-types) are specified at the end, in this case `tile_500`, which means 500x500 pixels.

### Video URIs ####

Authenticated with SHA1 hash and additional security token:

```
/api/v1/videos/51843134d75f4cbde534270cdd5954067f887ee6/10d68214/avc
```

In public mode without security token:

```
/api/v1/videos/51843134d75f4cbde534270cdd5954067f887ee6/public/avc
```

Videos can be streamed if the browser supports it. The format is specified at the end, in this case MPEG-4 AVC.

## Image Types ####

The smallest configurable size limit is 720px, so all formats up to `fit_720` should be generated by default while indexing.
Higher settings allow PhotoPrism to generate thumbnails with more detail in higher resolutions - either *statically* or
*dynamically* on demand.

## Storage Folders ##

Thumbnails are placed in sub-folders of `/storage/cache/thumbnails` based on the SHA1 hash of the original file,
for example:

```
/storage/cache/thumbnails/1/a/3/1a30c1f...9_100x100_center.jpg
```

## Downscaling Filters

### Linear

Bilinear interpolation takes a weighted average of the four
neighborhood pixels to calculate its final interpolated
value. The result is a much smoother image than the original
image. When all known pixel distances are equal, then the
interpolated value is simply their sum divided by four.
This technique performs interpolation in both directions,
horizontal and vertical. This technique gives better result
than nearest neighbor interpolation and take less
computation time compared to bicubic interpolation.

### Cubic

Catmull-Rom is a local interpolating spline developed for
computer graphics purposes. Its initial use was in design
of curves and surfaces, and has recently been used in
several applications. Catmull-Rom splines are a family of
cubic interpolating splines formulated such that the
tangent at each point is calculated using the previous and
next point on the spline. The results are similar to ones
produced by bicubic interpolation with regards to
sharpness, but the Catmull-Rom reconstruction is clearly
superior in smooth signal region.

### Lanczos

The Lanczos interpolation function is a mathematical formula
used to smoothly interpolate the value of a digital
image between its samples. It maps each sample of the
given image to a translated and scaled copy of the Lanczos
kernel, which is a sinc function windowed by the central
hump of a dilated sinc function. The sum of these
translated and scaled kernels is then evaluated at the
desired pixel. Lanczos interpolation has the **best
properties in terms of detail preservation and minimal
generation of aliasing artifacts** for geometric
transformations not involving strong down sampling.
However higher order Lanczos interpolation requires high
computational time, which makes it unsuitable for
most commercial software.

### Blackman

Blackman is a modification of Lanczos that has better control of ringing artifacts.

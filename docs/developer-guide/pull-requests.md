# How to Work With Pull Requests

Because we want to create the best possible product for our users, we have a set of guidelines which ensure that all source code contributions are acceptable. They are not intended as a filter or barrier to participation. If you are unfamiliar with open source development on GitHub, [we will help you](https://groups.google.com/a/photoprism.org/forum/#!forum/developers).

To submit new code, follow these steps:

### Fork our main repository ###
  * Click the [Fork button](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/) in the header of our [main repository](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism)
  * Clone the forked repository on your local computer: 
    * `git clone https://github.com/[your username]/photoprism`
  * Connect your local to our "upstream" main repository by [adding it as a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/): 
    * `git remote add upstream https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism.git` 
  * Create a new branch from `develop` - it should have a short and descriptive name (not "patch-1") that does not already exist, for example:
    * `git checkout -b feature/your_feature_name` 
  * See also https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

### Make your changes ###
  * While you are working on it and your pull request is not merged yet, pull in changes from "upstream" often so that you stay up to date and there is a lower risk for [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/):
    * `git fetch upstream`
    * `git merge upstream/develop`
  * We recommend running [tests](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/tests/) after each change to make sure you didn't break anything:
    * `make test`
  * **Add [tests](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/tests/) for any new code.** If you have questions about how to do this, please ask in your pull request.
  * Please run `make fmt` to ensure code is properly formatted according to our standards.
  * If all tests are green and you see no other errors, commit your changes. To reference related [GitHub issues](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues), please end your commit message with the issue ID like `#1234`:
      * `git status -s`
      * `git add .`
      * `git commit -m "Your commit message #1234"`

### When youâ€™re ready... ###
  * Sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/photoprism/photoprism).
  * Verify you didn't forget to add / commit files (output should be empty): 
    * `git status -s`
  * Push all commits to your forked remote repository on GitHub:
    * `git push -u origin feature/your_feature_name`
  * **[Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)** with a helpful description of what it does.
  * Wait for our code review and fix remaining issues, if any.
  * Write [documentation](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/documentation/) if you are adding new features or changing functionality. It is hosted on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/) and automatically updates whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

*Note: You can also create a pull request if your changes are not complete / working yet. Simply let us know that it is in progress, so that we don't try to merge it. We can help you with a code review or other feedback, if needed.*

    3. Repeat until all strings are translated
    
      Your translations will be reviewed and included in one of the next releases.

=== "Edit translations"

     If translations are missing, we pre-translate messages using services such as DeepL and Google Translate. This can lead to grammatical errors and misunderstandings. Native speakers should check existing translations and improve them if necessary.

     1. From your Dashboard open one of the components by clicking on the language

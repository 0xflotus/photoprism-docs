## Upcoming Features and Improvements ##

The [public roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, 
what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.

You are welcome to [submit specific feature requests](issues.md) if you have verified that no similar
[idea](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/idea) or [todo](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/todo)
already exists. Give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  , so that we know what is most popular.

    Our vision is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible.

## Questions? ##

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photoprism_app) or join our [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
to get regular updates, connect with other contributors, and discuss your ideas. Our [Code of Conduct](https://photoprism.app/code-of-conduct) explains the "dos and don‚Äôts."

## We Love Feedback ##

An important part of our journey is to explore new ways in product development and build better software through simplicity
and consistent use of community feedback. You are always [welcome to share your thoughts](../contact.md) with us.

## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](../getting-started/troubleshooting/index.md)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, or an issue has not been clearly
identified:

- you are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
- and post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions)

!!! example ""
    **Never report a bug unless you are sure you found a new problem that must be fixed directly in [our source code](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism):**

    - Ask for [technical support](../user-guide/index.md#getting-support) if you need help, it could be a local configuration issue, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
    - This gives our team the opportunity to [improve the documentation](documentation.md) and provide best-in-class support to you, instead of handling incomplete and/or duplicate bug reports
    - When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and [other information about your environment](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) such as [browser, browser plugins](../getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers.md), operating system, storage type, memory size, and processor

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Our step-by-step guide explains how to [submit pull requests](pull-requests.md).
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions.

    Simple, elegant solutions are [more effective](issues.md#effectiveness-efficiency), but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more
    time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable. ‚Äî <cite>Niklaus Wirth, Feb 1985</cite>

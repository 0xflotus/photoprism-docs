## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](../getting-started/troubleshooting/index.md)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, or an issue has not been clearly
identified:

- you are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
- or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions)

When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and [other information about your environment](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
such as [browser, browser plugins](../getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers.md), operating system, storage type,
memory size, and processor.

**We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue that must be fixed directly in the app.**
[Contact us](https://photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions)
if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works.

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Our step-by-step guide explains how to [submit pull requests](pull-requests.md).
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions.

    Simple, elegant solutions are [more effective](issues.md#effectiveness-efficiency), but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more
    time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable. ‚Äî <cite>Niklaus Wirth, Feb 1985</cite>

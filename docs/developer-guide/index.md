# Every Contribution Makes a Difference

Think of Open Source development as free training with a visible outcome.
Exploring new technologies is easier than in typical enterprise environments, where development efforts are more focused on immediate results.

We welcome contributions of any kind, including pull requests, ideas, bug reports, testing, writing documentation, tutorials, and blog posts. If you help with development, you'll have the opportunity to learn Docker, Go, TensorFlow, and more.

    Simple, elegant solutions are more effective, but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable.

    Our vision is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible.

The [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, 
what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.

Please give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  , so that we know what is most popular.
Ideas backed by silver and gold [sponsors](../funding.md) will be prioritized as well.

You are welcome to add specific feature requests directly to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues)
if no similar [idea](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/idea)
or [todo](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/todo) already exists.

# Every Contribution Makes a Difference

Think of Open Source development as free training with a visible outcome. Exploring new technologies is easier than in
traditional enterprise environments, where developers are often struggling to maintain legacy code that is laden with
technical debt.

We welcome contributions of any kind, including blog posts, tutorials, testing, writing documentation, and pull requests.

    time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable. ‚Äî Niklaus Wirth, Feb 1985

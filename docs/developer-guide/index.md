# Every Contribution Makes a Difference

Think of Open Source development as free training with a visible outcome.
Exploring new technologies is easier than in typical enterprise environments, where development efforts are more focused 
on immediate results.

We welcome contributions of any kind, including bug reports, testing, writing documentation, tutorials, blog posts, 
and pull requests. If you help with development, you'll have the opportunity to learn Docker, Go, TensorFlow, and more.

    Simple, elegant solutions are more effective, but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more 
    time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable. ‚Äî Niklaus Wirth, Feb 1985

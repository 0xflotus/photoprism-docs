### Import options ###

#### Move files ####
In case this option is selected, no copies are created but your original files will be renamed and moved to the `originals` folder.

!!! attention
    Import is not available in [read-only mode](../settings/library.md).
    
!!! tip 
    Enable `upload-nsfw` to prevent users from uploading offensive images via Web UI. 
    Note that you'll still be able to manually add such images to the `originals` or `import` folders and index them.

### What does private mean?
Some of your photos might be private for personal reasons. 
Our private functionality provides you with a solution to hide private photos or videos from some sections.
This way you can let family and friends browse through your photos without risking that they see photos you do not want them to see.

By default, photos marked as private will not appear in the following sections:

 * Photos
 * Videos
 * Labels
 * Places
 * Favorites
 * Shared albums
 
!!! info
    In case you want private content to appear everywhere you can configure that in the [settings](settings/ui.md).
 
### Mark photos as private
When adding/indexing new photos potentially private photos are marked as private automatically.
Be aware this algorithm is still in beta mode.

@Micha Können wir das optional machen? Also dem Nutzer die möglichkeit geben die private Funktion zu nutzen, aber ausschließlich manuell das private flag setzen?

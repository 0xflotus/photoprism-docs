!!! info
    Lots of metadata like labels, keywords, title, location, camera details are generated by PhotoPrism itself during indexing. 
    Once you change data manually PhotoPrism always keeps your data even if you index again.
    
!!! tip
    Every keyword can be used in PhotoPrisms search to find photos or videos.
    
### Labels
In the edit dialogue's Label tab you can view and edit [labels](labels.md).

### Files
In the edit dialogue's Files tab you see all files that belong to a photo.

In PhotoPrism a photo can consist of multiple files like a raw file + a jpeg version of this raw file + a related xmp or json file.

In case you have "Grouped Sequentials" enabled in [settings](settings.md) you might have photos that consist of more than one JPEG file.
In this case you can decide which one to use as primary by clicking the radio button in the files table.
The primary JPEG file is used in our views.

### Library Settings
#### Hide Private
Photos/videos marked as private do NOT appear in Photos, Videos, Favorites, Labels, Places and shared albums in case this option is selected.

#### Quality Filter
When selected, non-photographic photos/videos like screenshots and low-quality photos need to be [reviewed](review.md) before they appear in Photos or Videos.

#### Convert to JPEG
JPEGs are created for RAW files during [indexing](index.md) in case they do not yet exist. JPEGs will be stored in the same folder next to the original.

!!! attention
    In case this is disabled and there is a RAW file without a JPEG there will be no preview.
    
#### Group Sequential
Related files will be grouped when selected.
Grouped files will have one primary file that is shown in our views.

    1. Filenames are related: 'IMG_1234 (2)' or 'IMG_1234 copy 2' are assumed to belong to the same photo.
    2. Photos that have been taken at the same location AND in the same second.

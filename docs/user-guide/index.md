# User Guide #

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted community edition can be found
in [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md). All you need is a Web browser and 
[Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) to run the server.
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. PhotoPrism also runs on [DigitalOcean](../getting-started/cloud/digitalocean.md),
[Raspberry Pi](../getting-started/raspberry-pi.md), [FreeBSD](../getting-started/freebsd.md), and many
[NAS devices](../getting-started/nas/synology.md).

When setup is complete, you can start [indexing your pictures](library/index.md).
Be patient, this may take a while depending on your server hardware and how many files you have.

Your [photos](organize/browse.md) and [videos](organize/video.md) will successively become visible 
in search results and other parts of the user interface. The counts in the navigation are constantly 
updated, so you can follow the progress.

In case some of your pictures are still missing after indexing has been completed,
they might be in [Review](organize/review.md) due to low quality or incomplete metadata.
You can turn this and other features off in [Settings](settings/general.md), depending on
your specific use case.

# User Guide #

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted community edition can be found
in [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md). All you need to have installed on your
system is a Web browser and [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community).
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

When setup is complete, you can start [indexing your pictures](../user-guide/library/index.md).
Be patient, this may take a while depending on your server hardware and how many files you have.

Already indexed photos can be browsed in [Photos](../user-guide/organize/browse.md)
while videos show up in [Videos](../user-guide/organize/video.md).
Counts in the navigation are constantly updated, so you can follow the progress.

If photos are missing, they might be in [review](organize/review.md) due to low quality or missing metadata.
You can turn this and other features off in [Settings](settings/general.md), depending on
your specific use case.

!!! note ""
    The [stable version](../release-notes.md) and development preview now come as a single
    [multi-arch image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism) for **AMD64, ARM64, and ARMv7**.
    That means you don't need to pull from different Docker repositories anymore. We recommend updating your existing
    `docker-compose.yml` config based on [our examples](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/).

All you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

Next, you'll have to [index or import](importvsindex.md) existing photos and videos.
Please be patient, this will take a while depending on the number of files.

Already indexed photos can be browsed in [Photos](browse.md) while videos show up in [Videos](video.md).
Counts are continuously updated in the navigation.

If photos are missing, they might be in review due to low quality or missing metadata.
You can turn this and other features off in [Settings](settings.md), depending on
your specific use case and requirements.

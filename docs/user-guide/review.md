# Review non-photographic and low-quality images #
When adding new photos a quality score from 1 to 5 is created automatically.
Photos with a quality score lower than 3 do not appear in Photos until you approve them (unless review was disabled
in [Settings](settings/ui.md))

The quality score depends on the following:

* Known date and/or GPS coordinates
* At least 2 MP resolution if taken after 2012
* Photo not classified as info or screenshot
* Photo is favorite, was edited or approved

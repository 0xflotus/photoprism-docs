# Synchronize photos from your tablet or phone #
To synchronize photos/videos from your phone to PhotoPrism, you can use any app that supports file sync via webDAV.

We recommend [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/home.html) which is available for Android and iOS.

As long as you run photoprism on a device where it is possible to enable Samba (Windows File Sharing), you can use this free opensource Android app:

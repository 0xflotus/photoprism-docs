# Connecting via WebDAV #

WebDAV clients, like Microsoftâ€™s Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder,
can connect directly to PhotoPrism.
This mounts the *originals folder* as a network drive and allows you to open, edit, and delete
files from your computer or smartphone as if they were local.

!!! note ""
    PhotoPrism can also sync files *from* an external storage system (like ownCloud) via WebDAV.
    See [instructions](/user-guide/settings/sync/).

The originals folder URL for public servers is:

```
https://admin@example.com/originals/
```

Please replace *example.com* with your actual domain.
The slash at the end is important and cannot be omitted.

When connecting, you'll have to authenticate using your regular password.
It will also change when you update it in *Settings*. The user name is `admin`.

!!! info ""
    You can also connect to the import folder by replacing `originals/` with `import/` in the URL.

For users, who are running PhotoPrism locally on the default port *2342*, the *originals* folder URL is:

```
http://admin@localhost:2342/originals/
```

!!! attention ""
    Never use WebDAV **without HTTPS** outside your local, private network as your
    password would be transmitted, in clear text, over the Internet. Backup tools and file sync apps 
    like [FolderSync](https://www.tacit.dk/foldersync/faq/#i-can-not-connect-to-a-non-https-webdav-server-why)
    may refuse to connect as well.

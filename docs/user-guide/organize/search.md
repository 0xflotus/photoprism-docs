# Search #
In all sections you can use the search bar to find certain photos, videos, albums or labels.

You can search for all kind of things:

* Objects that are displayed on the photo
* The main color of the photo
* The filename or foldername of a photo
* Location where the photo has been taken
* ...

Just try it!

!!! tip
    In case you want to search for multiple things at once, enter the terms separated by a space.
    
    A search for `cat blue berlin` will find all photos that either display a cat, have blue as main color or have been taken in Berlin.

## Filters ##
Additionally to the search you can set filters for:

* Country
* Year
* Order
* Camera
* Lens

In case you set multiple filters only photos are shown in the search result that fulfill all filter criteria.

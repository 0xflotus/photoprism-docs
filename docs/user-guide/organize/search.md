    In case you want to search for multiple things at once, enter the terms separated by a space.
    
    A search for `cat blue berlin` will find all photos that either display a cat, have blue as main color or have been taken in Berlin.

## Filters ##
Additionally to the search you can set filters for:

* Country
* Year

## AND Search ##
Filters can be combined, use a space between filters:

```
mono:true review:false
```

It will show photos that are monochrome **and** unreviewed.

## OR Search ##
An OR search is possible using `|`:

```
label:cat|dog
```

This will show all photos that have either the label cat **or** dog.

## Wildcard ##
The `*` character will act as a wildcard:

```
name:"IMG_23*"
```

This will show all photos which name start with `IMG_23`.


```
name:"*_23*"
```

This will show all photos which name contain `_23`, like `IMG_2356.MOV` , `2021_02_23.jpg`, etc.

    Every keyword can be used in PhotoPrisms search to find photos or videos.
    
#### Geolocation Plugin ####

Geolocation Plugin is an [open source extension](https://github.com/andyvalerio/photoprism-geolocation) that makes it easy to change latitude and longitude of a photo by selecting places on a graphical map. It can be [installed through the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geolocation-plugin-for-ph/oggmpodnbdcmfiognbkkeffacpeaifch).

# Browse through your photo collection #
PhotoPrisms photo/video views are a nice way for you to browse through your photo collection.
They enable you to re-discover forgotten photos, find specific photos you are looking for or organize your photos.

### Sections ###
Using the main navigation you can visit the different sections of your photo library:

#### Photos ####
:material-image: shows all photos that are not in review or archived or private.

!!! hint
    In case the review, private or archive functions are turned off - Photos displays those photos as well.

### Search ###
In all sections you can use the search bar to find certain photos, videos, albums or labels.

You can search for all kind of things:

* Objects that are displayed on the photo
* The main color of the photo
* The filename or foldername of a photo
* Location where the photo has been taken
* ...

Just try it!

!!! tip
    In case you want to search for multiple things at once, enter the terms separated by a space.
    
    A search for `cat blue berlin` will find all photos that either display a cat, have blue as main color or have been taken in Berlin.

### Filters ###
Additionally to the search you can set filters for:

* Country
* Year
* Order
* Camera
* Lens
* Color
* Category

In case you set multiple filters only photos are shown in the search result that fulfill all filter criteria.

    `color:green`

To switch between views you can either use the filter in the filter bar or the view button (:material-view-column:, :material-view-comfy:, :material-view-list:) in the upper right corner.


Additionally you can open your photos/videos in fullscreen mode and start a slideshow (:material-play:).

PhotoPrism automatically detects faces and clusters them.

Each time you assign a name to a face or change an existing assignment, PhotoPrism improves face clusters intelligently.

## People Section ##
The people section shows you recognized persons as well as new face clusters.

To star a person click :material-star:. Stared persons appear first.

!!!info
    As not all faces belong to a cluster, there might be more faces than visible in the New section.
    You find all photos with faces that are not assigned to a person using the search filter `face:new`.
    The photo [*edit dialogue*](edit.md) shows all faces of a photo independent from whether they are clustered or not.

## Assign Names to Faces ##
1. Go to *People*
2. Go to *New*
3. Click on the input field
4. Start typing a name
5. Press *enter*

2. Go to the *People* tab
3. Click on the input field

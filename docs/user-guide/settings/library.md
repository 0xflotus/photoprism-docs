# Library Settings

## Index ##

#### :material-lock: Hide Private ####

Excludes content marked as private from search results, shared albums, labels and places.

#### :material-eye: Quality Filter ####

Non-photographic and low-quality images require a [review](../organize/review.md) before they appear in search results.

#### :material-camera: Convert to JPEG ####

Automatically creates JPEGs for other file types so that they can be displayed in a browser.

!!! attention
    *Convert to JPEG* should not be disabled as this will effectively prevent PhotoPrism from indexing
    file types other than JPEG - unless files were already converted to JPEG, and stored using the same file name prefix.

## Stacks ##

Stacks group files with a similar frame of reference, but differences of quality, format, size or color.
Go to *Photos > [Stacks](../organize/stacks.md)* to see all photo stacks in your library.

PhotoPrism offers three methods for stacking files:

* :material-clock-outline: Place & Time 
* :material-fingerprint: Unique ID
* :material-format-list-numbered-rtl: Sequential Name

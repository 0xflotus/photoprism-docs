## Maps & Places ##

At the bottom of the *General* settings tab, you may choose your preferred map style and animation length.
PhotoPrism includes four high-resolution world maps to see where you've been, and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots.

To enhance your photos with location data such as state, city and category, we've also launched our own geo-information service based on OpenStreetMap.
A future release will additionally provide public events' data, so that albums of popular music festivals, or sports gatherings, can be created automatically.

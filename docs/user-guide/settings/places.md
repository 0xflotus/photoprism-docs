# PhotoPrism Places #

The app includes four high-resolution world maps to see where you've been, and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots. 
To enhance your photos with location data such as state, city and category, we've recently launched our own geo-information service based on OpenStreetMap.
 A future release will additionally provide public events' data, so that albums of popular music festivals, or sports gatherings, can be created automatically.
## Privacy ##

Geocoding requests are NOT logged, but developers can of course see cached items in MariaDB without personal information. That's the point of a cache. Those will be randomly distributed with hot spots around tourist attractions and big cities.

Because of HTTPS, your internet provider can't see the exact request, just that you contacted a server.

The API approximates coordinates, encodes them with [S2](https://s2geometry.io/resources/s2cell_statistics.html) and doesn't care about street or house number:

## Performance ##

First [benchmarks](https://github.com/tsliwowicz/go-wrk) show that up to 2500 req/s can be handled. Compare this with the pricing of commercial providers and you'll see the value. Response times range from 10ms to 7Î¼s, depending on the query and cache.

If you prefer running this on-site: We use a 6-core Intel Xeon processor, 320 GB of SSD and 16 GB of memory. 
In addition you'll have to download ~100 GB of data.
Due to the properties of S2 cell IDs, scaling and sharding should be easy if needed.

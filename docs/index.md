# PhotoPrism: Browse Your Life in Pictures

PhotoPrism® is a privately hosted app for browsing, organizing, and sharing your photo collection. 
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way. 
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud!

## Key Features ##

* Our intuitive [user interface](https://demo.photoprism.org/) makes browsing and organizing your photo collection as easy as
  it should be — whether it’s on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
* Index everything without worrying about duplicates or [RAW to JPEG conversion](developer-guide/library/converting.md).
* Automatic [image classification](developer-guide/metadata/classification.md)
  based on Google TensorFlow. In addition, our indexer detects _colors_, _chroma_, _luminance_, _quality_, _panoramic projection_,
  _location type_, and many other properties.
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been,
  and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots.
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoft’s Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, may
  [connect](user-guide/sync/webdav.md) directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open,
  edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local.
  You may easily sync your pictures with [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/) as well.
* Because PhotoPrism is built as a [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), 
  it provides a native app-like experience, and you may install it on your home screen.

## Features ##

* PhotoPrism makes browsing and organizing your pictures as easy as it should be, whether itâ€™s on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer
* Because the [user interface](https://demo.photoprism.org/) is a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
  it provides a native app-like experience, and you can easily install it on the home screen of common operating systems and devices
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been,
  and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots
* Play Live Photosâ„¢ by hovering over them in albums and search results
* Enjoy privacy-preserving face detection and recognition ðŸ’Ž
* AI-powered [image classification](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/metadata/classification/)
  based on Google TensorFlow
* Metadata can be extracted and merged from Exif, XMP, and proprietary formats such as Google Photos JSON sidecar files
* Image properties like _colors_, _chroma_, _luminance_, _quality_, _panoramic projection_, and _location type_
  will be detected automatically whenever you update the index or import files
* Index all your photos and videos without worrying about duplicates, the conversion of [RAW images](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/settings/library/), or video transcoding
* Use [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/) to securely backup iOS and Android mobile devices in the background
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoftâ€™s Windows Explorer and Apple's Finder, may
  [connect](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/sync/webdav/) directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open,
  edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local

# PhotoPrism: Browse Your Life in Pictures

PhotoPrismâ„¢ is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the public cloud.

### What to expect... ###

* Clearly structured Web interface for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection
* Import everything without worrying about duplicates or RAW to JPEG conversion
* Reverse geocoding, XMP support and automated tagging based on Google TensorFlow

## Why This Has to Be Free Software ##

The development of every commercial product is focused on monetization.
We've [built similar apps more than once](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Mediencenter) and every single time the constraints of working
in a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment.

We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - can be very powerful.
Go itself is a [great example](https://talks.golang.org/2015/simplicity-is-complicated.slide).

Our long-term goal is to become an open platform for machine learning [research](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Research) based on real-world photo collections.
We're already in contact with data scientists who like our idea.

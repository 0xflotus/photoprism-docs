## Key Features ##

* Our intuitive [Web UI](https://demo.photoprism.org/) makes browsing and organizing your photo collection as easy as
  it should be â€” whether itâ€™s on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer
* Index all your photos and videos without worrying about duplicates, [RAW to JPEG conversion](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/settings/library/), or video transcoding
* Enjoy privacy-preserving face detection and recognition ðŸ’Ž
* Automatic [image classification](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/metadata/classification/)
  based on Google TensorFlow â€“ in addition, PhotoPrism detects many other properties such as _colors_, _chroma_, _luminance_, _quality_, _panoramic projection_,
  and _location type_
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been,
  and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots
* Use [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/) to securely backup iOS and Android mobile devices in the background
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoftâ€™s Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, may
  [connect](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/sync/webdav/) directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open,
  edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local
* Because PhotoPrism is built as a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
  it provides a native app-like experience, and you can install it on your home screen without struggling with compatibility issues

# PhotoPrism: Browse Your Life in Pictures

PhotoPrism® is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.

Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud!

## Key Features ##

* Our clearly structured user interface makes organizing and sharing your personal photo collection as easy as 
  it should be — whether it’s on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
* Import everything without worrying about duplicates or RAW to JPEG conversion.
* Automatic image classification based on Google TensorFlow. In addition, our indexer detects colors, 
  chroma, luminance, projection, location type, quality, and many other properties.
* Includes four high-resolution world maps to see where you've been and for rediscovering 
  long-forgotten shots.
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoft’s Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, can connect directly to 
  PhotoPrism so that you to can open, edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local. 
  You may easily sync your pictures with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) as well.  
* PhotoPrism feels like a native app and, of course, you can also add it to your home screen.

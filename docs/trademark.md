# Trademark and Brand Guidelines

When referring to PhotoPrismÂ®, make sure that it is spelled correctly:

* PhotoPrism is one word and must not be separated into two words
* It has two capitals, so Photoprism is not a correct spelling

Please always use our [official logo](https://dl.photoprism.org/img/logo/logo.svg), do not alter it in any way,
and avoid overlapping with other logos or images.

Our [guidelines](https://photoprism.app/trademark), which may be updated from time to time, describe how our 
Brand Assets may be used. It is important to us that any permitted use of our Brand Assets is fair and meets 
the highest standards. To ensure this, we reserve the right to object to any use or misuse in any jurisdiction 
worldwide.

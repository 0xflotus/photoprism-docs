# Trademark and Brand Guidelines

When referring to PhotoPrismÂ®, make sure that it is spelled correctly:

* PhotoPrism is one word and must not be separated into two words
* It has two capitals, so Photoprism is not a correct spelling

Also, please use our [official logo](https://dl.photoprism.org/img/logo/logo.svg), do not alter it in any way,
and avoid overlapping with other logos or images.

It is important to us that any permitted use of our brand assets is fair and meets the highest standards.
To ensure this, we reserve the right to revoke your permission at any time and for any reason.

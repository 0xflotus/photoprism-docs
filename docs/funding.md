# Funding

PhotoPrism is about freedom and privacy but not about free beer. We feel like it
would be a mistake to state there will be no costs because clearly, we have huge expenses, your server hardware
will have a price tag, and then maybe you'd like to have some extra features that need to be developed.

If you enjoy using our software, please consider backing us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism)
or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism) — especially if you have
feature requests or need help with using our software.

Your continued support helps us fund operating costs, external services like satellite maps,
and develop new features.
Ideas backed by silver or gold sponsors are marked with a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor).
Let us know if we mistakenly [label an idea as unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

Thank you very much! ❤️

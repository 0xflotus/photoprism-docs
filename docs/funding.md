# Funding

**We value freedom and privacy.** Serving free beer[^1] does not bring us closer to our vision.

Please back us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism)
if you like PhotoPrism. Your continued support helps us provide services like satellite maps and develop new features.

Ideas endorsed by silver and [gold sponsors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) 
receive a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) and will be prioritized. Let us know when we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

Thank you very much! üíú

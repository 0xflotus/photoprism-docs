    **We value freedom and privacy.** Serving free beer can make you many friends, that was never our motivation though.
    It doesn't seem right to imply that there is no cost because clearly, we have huge expenses, your server 
    hardware will have a price tag, and then maybe you'd like to have some extra features that need to be developed.

Your continued support helps us fund operating costs, provide services like satellite maps,
and develop new features.
Requests endorsed by silver and gold sponsors [receive a golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) and will be prioritized.
Let us know when we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

Thank you very much! ðŸ’œ

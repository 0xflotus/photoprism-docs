# Funding

It's clear many users are waiting for a stable release while only very few donate or help with development. 
This project is about freedom but not necessarily about free beer. We are not Google and don't have billions of 
dollars on our bank accounts to give away to our fans in exchange for their data.

It's also somewhat disappointing how little support we get by companies and especially public organizations. 
Not a single dollar. 
Every politician wants to support Open Source and warns social media is bad for your privacy, but only very 
few are willing to help those that actually do something.

The consequence is that we are forced to think about monetization. We honestly didn't expect this will be an issue 
and didn't ask for anything the first year. Thank you very much to our few sponsors! 
We still love each and everyone of you, even those that send multiple pages of written requirements and then ask 
every week when it is done.

Specific solutions could be to offer...
  - a paid, tested & supported version in the app store while our contributors and other developers can 
    continue to use Docker or build from source
  - a geodata, public events and maps subscription since OpenStreetMap doesn't want us to use their development 
    API for production

## Donations

You're most welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero), 
especially if you need help with using our software. They will match every donation in the first year.
In addition, you can find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism). 
Our sponsors and contributors will get for free whatever we might have to charge for a geodata,
public events and maps subscription later.

Also please leave a [star](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/stargazers) on GitHub if you like this project, 
it provides enough motivation to keep going. Thank you very much! <3

Ideas backed by a sponsor are marked with a golden [sponsor](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) label.
Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

## Public and corporate sponsorship ##

Our software is now almost done after two years of hard work, some days 16 to 20 hours on top of other projects we
did to finance this. We spent weeks asking organizations like [The Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/) 
for help and also tried to cooperate with companies like Mapbox and Cewe. We have been ignored and even given
the advice that what we do "already exists in America".

If any of those organizations changes their mind, they are welcome to [reach out to us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org).

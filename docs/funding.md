# Funding

**We value freedom and privacy.** Serving free beer can make you many friends. It is not our motivation though.
Your server hardware comes at a price, just as we have large expenses for our infrastructure and team.

Please back us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism)
if you like our software and can't contribute in any other way. Your continued support helps us provide services like 
satellite maps and develop new features.

Ideas endorsed by silver and [gold sponsors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) 
receive a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) and will be prioritized. Let us know when we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

Thank you very much! ðŸ’œ

# Funding

**We value freedom and privacy.** Serving free beer[^1] doesn't bring us closer to our vision 
and doesn't get you better software.

Please back us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism)
if you enjoy PhotoPrism. Your continued support helps us provide services like world maps and develop new features.

We currently have the following sponsorship options:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism) is priced in USD, also offers [one-time donations](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism?frequency=one-time), and takes a small commission for currency conversion as we're based in Berlin.
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) has a higher commission, is priced in Euro, and offers yearly payments. That may be a plus for some.
- Stripe will be available in early 2022, so you can sign up directly in the app without having a Patreon or GitHub account.
- You're welcome to [contact us](https://photoprism.app/contact) for other options.

Sponsors receive direct [technical support](https://photoprism.app/contact) via email
and have access to additional features. Ideas endorsed by [silver, 
gold, and platinum sponsors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) 
receive a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) and
will be prioritized on the [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5). Thank you! üíú

[^1]: Think of ‚Äúfree software‚Äù as in ‚Äúfree speech,‚Äù not as in ‚Äúfree beer.‚Äù We sometimes call it ‚Äúlibre software,‚Äù borrowing the French or Spanish word for ‚Äúfree‚Äù as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis. (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

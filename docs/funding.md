# Funding

**We value freedom and privacy.** Serving free beer[^1] doesn't bring us closer to our vision 
and doesn't get you better software.

Please back us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism)
if you enjoy PhotoPrism. Your continued support helps us provide services like satellite maps and develop new features.
GitHub now also offers [one-time donations](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism?frequency=one-time).
You're welcome to [contact us](https://photoprism.app/contact) for other options.

Our sponsors receive direct [technical support](https://photoprism.app/contact) via email
and have access to additional features. Ideas endorsed by silver, 
[gold and platinum sponsors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) 
receive a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) and 
will be prioritized. 

Thank you very much! üíú

[^1]: Think of ‚Äúfree software‚Äù as in ‚Äúfree speech,‚Äù not as in ‚Äúfree beer.‚Äù We sometimes call it ‚Äúlibre software,‚Äù borrowing the French or Spanish word for ‚Äúfree‚Äù as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis. (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

# Funding

This project is about freedom and privacy but not necessarily about free beer. We feel like it
would be a mistake to state there will be no costs, because clearly we have huge expenses, your server hardware
will have a price tag and then maybe you'd like to have some extra features that need to be developed.

You're welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism), 
especially if you have feature requests or need help with using our software.
In addition, you can find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/browseyourlife). 

Your continuous support helps...

* to pay for hosting, hardware and external services like satellite maps
* developing new features, and keeping them free for everyone ðŸŒˆ

Also, please [leave a star](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/stargazers) on GitHub if you like this project. 
It provides additional motivation to keep going.

Thank you very much! <3

Ideas backed by one or more eligible sponsors are marked with a golden [sponsor](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) label.
Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

Looking forward, specific solutions for funding development and maintenance could be to...

  - provide additional benefits to our sponsors
  - sell a tested & supported version in the app store while our contributors and other developers can 
    continue to use Docker or build from source
  - develop a one-click solution for private cloud hosting together with selected providers we trust

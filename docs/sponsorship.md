# Let's join forces

PhotoPrism is a non-profit project run entirely by volunteers. We need your funds to pay for 
[organizing meetups](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Meetups),
[running our servers](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Infrastructure),
visiting conferences, buying test devices, offering rewards for contributions, and covering our cost of living.

You're most welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero). They will match every donation in the first year.

Also please leave a star there if you like this project, it provides enough motivation to keep going. Thank you very much! <3

In addition, you can find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism). It really means a lot to us as we haven't received any major financial support so far and are funding this project from our personal savings.

## Corporate Sponsorship ##

Please [reach out to us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you work for an organization that can [support our project](https://dl.photoprism.org/slides/PhotoPrism.pdf)
as we are looking for a way to continue doing this full-time.
We'll be happy to mention your contribution plus you'll get a direct line to [our team](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/team/) of top-class engineers and scientists.

See [SPONSORS.md](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) in our main repository for details.

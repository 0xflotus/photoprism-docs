# Let's join forces

Developing open-source software is a [community effort](https://photoprism.org/downloads/PhotoPrism.pdf).
Solid funding enables us to quickly implement features and integrate with services you care about.

Please visit our new [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) page or [reach out](mailto:hello@photoprism.org)
to us if you work for an organization that would like to [sponsor our project](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md).
Grants and donations will be used for organizing meetups, visiting conferences, buying test devices,
offering perks for contributions, and covering our cost of living.

Your support is highly appreciated and will have significant impact on our work.

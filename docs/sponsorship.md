# Let's join forces

PhotoPrism is a non-profit project run entirely by volunteers. We need your funds to pay for 
[organizing meetups](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Meetups),
[running our servers](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Infrastructure),
visiting conferences, buying test devices, offering rewards for contributions, and covering our cost of living.

Please [reach out to us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you work for an
organization that can [support our project](https://dl.photoprism.org/slides/PhotoPrism.pdf)
as we are looking for a way to continue doing this full-time.

We'll be happy to mention your contribution plus you'll get a direct line to [our team](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/team/) of top-class engineers and scientists.

See [SPONSORS.md](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) in our main repository for details.

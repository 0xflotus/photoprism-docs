# Let's join forces

We are open to sponsorship proposals to improve our funding while we continue working on our first release and beyond.
Ideally it also enables us to offer perks for contributions and explore new ways of organizing product development.

In exchange, we would love to share our knowledge and experience with you or your team, either on-site or remote. We can also
help you getting existing photo collections tagged or build an API that integrates with your infrastructure.

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you're interested in pursuing this unique opportunity.

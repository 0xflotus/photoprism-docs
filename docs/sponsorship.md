# Let's join forces

PhotoPrism is a non-profit project run entirely by volunteers. We need your funds to pay for 
[organizing meetups](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Meetups),
[running our servers](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Infrastructure),
visiting conferences, buying test devices, offering rewards for contributions, and covering our cost of living.

You're most welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero), 
especially if you need help with using our software. They will match every donation in the first year.
In addition, you can find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism). 

Also please leave a star if you like this project, it provides enough motivation to keep going. Thank you very much! <3

Ideas backed by a sponsor are marked with a golden [sponsor](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) label.
Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

## Corporate Sponsorship ##

Our software is now almost done after two years of hard work, some days 16 to 20 hours on top of other projects we
did to finance this. We spent weeks asking organizations like [The Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/) 
for help and also tried to cooperate with companies like Mapbox and Cewe. We have been ignored and even given
the advice that what we do "already exists in America".

If any of those organizations changes their mind, they are welcome to [reach out to us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org).

# Let's join forces

We welcome support from corporate sponsors and foundations to improve our funding while we continue working on 
our first release and beyond: From providing test devices and offering perks for contributions to covering the 
cost of living for a full-time developer.

In exchange, we are happy to mention your support and would love to share our experience with you or your team, 
either on-site or remote. We can also help you getting existing photo collections tagged or build an API that 
integrates with your infrastructure.

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you work for an organization that might want to support our project.

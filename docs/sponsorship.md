# Let's join forces

Developing PhotoPrism is a community effort. We welcome sponsorship proposals to improve our funding while we 
continue working on our first release and beyond: From providing test devices, offering perks for contributions
to covering the cost of living for a full-time developer. 

In exchange, we are happy to mention your support and would love to share our experience with you or your team, 
either on-site or remote. We can also help you getting existing photo collections tagged or build an API that 
integrates with your infrastructure.

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you are interested in becoming a sponsor or work for an 
organization that might want to support our project.

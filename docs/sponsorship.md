# Let's join forces

We are open to sponsorship proposals to improve our funding while we continue working on our first release and beyond.
Ideally it also enables us to offer perks for contributions and explore new ways of organizing product development.

In exchange, we are happy to mention your support and would love to share our experience with you or your team, 
either on-site or remote. We can also help you getting existing photo collections tagged or build an API that 
integrates with your infrastructure.

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you want to support this project by becoming a sponsor.

# Let's join forces

Please [reach out](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) to us if you work for an organization that would like to sponsor our project.
Grants will be used for organizing meetups, visiting conferences, buying test devices, offering perks for contributions
and covering the cost of living for full-time developers.

In exchange, we are happy to mention your support and would love to share our experience with you or your team,
either on-site or remote. We can also help you getting existing photo collections tagged or build an API that
integrates with your infrastructure.

# Make a difference

Our ongoing progress encourages us to continue working towards a stable release that can be used by everyone.

Sponsoring can provide a sustainable way to cover our cost of living during that time. Ideally it also enables us to offer perks for contributions and explore
new ways of organizing product development.

In exchange, we would love to share our knowledge and experience with you or your team, either on-site or remote. We can also
help you getting existing photo collections labeled or build an API that integrates with your infrastructure.

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you're interested in pursuing this unique opportunity.

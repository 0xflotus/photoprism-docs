# Backup

There are two primary things you need to backup:

1. Your pictures
2. Photoprism's database

All your pictures reside in your "Originals" directory.
Including that one in your backup is essential to avoid data loss.

In regards to photoprism's database, the easiest way is to use the built-in `backup` command.
See `photoprism backup --help` for detailed information on how to use it.

# For the early birds

You are welcome to get an impression and provide early feedback.
We've set up a public demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org) for you to play with.

Note that this is work in progress. We do our best to provide a complete, stable version. 
[Financial support](../funding.md) makes a huge difference and enables us to spend more time with this project.

## System Requirements ##

We recommend at least 2 cores and 4 GB of RAM for running PhotoPrism. Indexing large photo and 
video collections significantly benefits from fast, local SSD storage and enough memory for caching. 

If you're running out of memory, you can reduce the number of workers in the configuration. 
As a measure of last resort, you can additionally disable image classification using TensorFlow.

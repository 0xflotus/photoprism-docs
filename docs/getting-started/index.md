You are welcome to get an impression and provide early feedback.
We've set up a public demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org) for you to play with.

Note that this is work in progress. We do our best to provide a complete, stable version.

!!! info    
    Due to popular request, our latest demo now also supports TIFF, PNG, BMP and GIF files. 
    Be aware that files in those formats often don't contain useful metadata and are typically 
    used for screenshots, charts, graphs and icons only.

## System Requirements ##

We recommend at least 2 cores and 4 GB of RAM for running PhotoPrism. Indexing large photo and 
video files significantly benefits from fast, local SSD storage and enough memory for caching. 

If you're running out of memory, you can reduce the number of workers in the configuration. 
As a measure of last resort, you can additionally disable image classification using TensorFlow.

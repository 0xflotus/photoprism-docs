# Setup Using Docker Compose

Before you start, make sure you have [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) 
installed on your system. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

### Step 1: Configure ###

=== "Linux"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/docker-compose.yml) example
    (right click and *Save Link As...* or use `wget`) to a folder of your choice,
    and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:
    
    ```
    wget https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/docker-compose.yml
    ``` 
    
    Commands on Linux may have to be prefixed with `sudo` when not running as root.
    Note that this will point the home directory placeholder `~` to `/root` in volume mounts.
    Kernel security modules such as AppArmor and SELinux have been reported to cause
    [issues](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/faq/#why-is-photoprism-getting-stuck-in-a-restart-loop).

=== "Raspberry Pi"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml) example for 
    the Raspberry Pi (right click and *Save Link As...* or use `wget`) to a folder of your choice,
    and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:
    
    ```
    wget https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    Mostly the same installation instructions as for regular Linux servers apply.
    Commands may have to be prefixed with `sudo` when not running as root.
    Ensure your device meets the [system requirements](raspberry-pi.md) before you continue.

        Owners of ARMv7-based devices have to revert to an [alternative image](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/mariadb)
        if they want to use MariaDB. The [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) is available for AMD64 and ARM64 only.
        Pay close attention to changed directory and environment variable names.

=== "Windows"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/windows/docker-compose.yml) example for Windows
    (right click and *Save Link As...*) to a folder of your choice, and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:
 
    [https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/windows/docker-compose.yml :material-download:](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/windows/docker-compose.yml)

    Windows Pro users should [disable](img/docker-disable-wsl2.jpg) the WSL 2 based engine in *Docker Settings > General* 
    so that they can mount drives other than `C:`. This will enable Hyper-V, which 
    [Microsoft doesn't offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements) 
    to its Windows Home customers. Docker Desktop uses dynamic memory allocation with WSL 2. It's important 
    to explicitly [increase the Docker memory limit](img/docker-resources-advanced.jpg) to 4 GB or more when using 
    Hyper-V. The default of 2 GB may reduce indexing performance and cause unexpected restarts.

=== "macOS"

    Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/macos/docker-compose.yml) example for macOS
    (right click and *Save Link As...*) to a folder of your choice, and change the [configuration](config-options.md) as needed:

    [https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/macos/docker-compose.yml :material-download:](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/macos/docker-compose.yml)
    
    It's important to [increase the Docker memory limit](img/docker-resources-advanced.jpg) to 4 GB or more,
    as the default of 2 GB may reduce indexing performance and cause unexpected restarts.

!!! danger ""
    Always change `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` so that the app starts with a **secure initial password**.
    Never use easy-to-guess passwords or default values like `insecure` on publicly accessible servers.
    There is no default in case no password was provided. A minimum length of 4 characters is required.

#### Volumes ####

Since the app is running inside a container, you have to explicitly mount the folders you want to use.
PhotoPrism won't be able to see folders that have not been mounted. That's an important security feature.

##### /photoprism/originals #####

The *originals* folder contains your original photo and video files.

They will be mounted from `~/Pictures` by default, where `~` is a placeholder for 
your [home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory). All folders accessible from 
the host [may be mounted](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes), 
including network drives. 

Multiple folders can be made accessible by mounting them as subfolders:

```
volumes:
  - "~/friends:/photoprism/originals/friends"
  - "/media/photos:/photoprism/originals/media"
```

##### /photoprism/import #####

You may optionally mount an *import* folder from which files can be transferred to the *originals* folder
in a structured way that avoids duplicates. Imported files receive a canonical filename and will be
organized by year and month.

!!! note ""
    You can safely skip this. Adding files via [Web Upload](../user-guide/library/upload.md)
    and [WebDAV](../user-guide/sync/webdav.md) remains possible, unless [read-only mode](config-options.md)
    is enabled or the [features have been disabled](../user-guide/settings/general.md).

##### /photoprism/storage #####

Cache, session, thumbnail, and sidecar files will be created in the *storage* folder. Never remove the volume from
your `docker-compose.yml` file so that you don't lose these files after restarting or upgrading the container.

!!! info "Read-Only Mode"
    Running PhotoPrism in read-only mode disables all features that require write permissions,
    like importing, uploading, renaming, and deleting files.
    You may enable it by setting `PHOTOPRISM_READONLY` to `"true"`.
    In addition, you may mount the *originals* folder with `:ro` flag so that Docker 
    blocks write operations.

### Step 2: Start the server ###

Open a terminal and change to the folder in which the `docker-compose.yml` file has been saved.
Run this command to start the app and database in the background:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Now open the Web UI by navigating to http://localhost:2342/. You should see a login screen.
Sign in with the user `admin` and the initial password configured via `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
You may change it on the [account settings page](../user-guide/settings/account.md).
Enabling [public mode](config-options.md) will disable authentication.

!!! hint ""
    If you can't connect, try starting the app without `-d`: `docker-compose up photoprism`. 
    This keeps it in the foreground and shows log messages for troubleshooting. You're welcome to ask 
    for help in our [community chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community).
    Should the server already be running, or you see no errors, you may have started it
    on a different host and/or port. There could also be an issue with your browser,
    ad blocker, or firewall settings.

!!! note ""
    For security reasons, it is **not possible to change the password** via `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` after 
    the app has been started for the first time. You may run `docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism passwd` 
    in a terminal to change an existing password. You can also reset your database for a clean start.

The server port and [config options](config-options.md) may be changed in `docker-compose.yml` at any time.
Remember to restart the app for changes to take effect:

```
docker-compose stop photoprism
docker-compose up -d photoprism
```

### Step 3: Index your library ###

!!! attention ""
    Ensure there is enough disk space available for creating thumbnails and verify file system permissions
    before starting to index: Files in the *originals* folder must be readable, while the *storage* folder
    including all subdirectories must be readable and writeable.

Open the Web UI, go to *Library* and click *Start* to start indexing your pictures.

While indexing, JPEG sidecar files may be created for originals in other formats such as RAW and HEIF. 
This is required for image classification, facial recognition, and for displaying them in a Web browser. 
Sidecar and thumbnail files will be added to the *storage* folder, so that your *originals* folder won't be modified.

Your [photos](../user-guide/organize/browse.md) and [videos](../user-guide/organize/video.md) will 
successively become visible in search results and other parts of the user interface. 
Open the *Logs* tab in *Library* to watch the indexer working.

Of course, you can continue using your favorite tools for processing RAW files, editing metadata, 
or importing new shots. Go to *Library* and click *Start* to update the index after files have been 
changed, added, or removed. This can also be automated using CLI commands and a [scheduler](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/scheduler/).

Easy, isn't it?

!!! info "Reducing Server Load"
    If you're running out of memory - or other system resources - while indexing, try limiting the 
    [number of workers](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/config-options/) by setting
    `PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS` to a reasonably small value in `docker-compose.yml` (depending on your CPU and expectations).
    Also make sure your server has at least 4 GB of [swap](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/swap-space-linux-systems) 
    configured so that indexing doesn't cause restarts when there are memory usage spikes.
    Especially the conversion of RAW images and the transcoding of videos are very demanding.
    As a measure of last resort, you may disable using TensorFlow for image classification and facial recognition.

### Command-Line Interface ###

`photoprism help` lists all commands and config options available in the current version:

```
docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism help
```

Use the `--help` flag to see a detailed command description, for example:

```
docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism backup --help
```

!!! tip ""
    Prefixing commands with `docker-compose exec [service name]` runs them inside an app container.
    If this fails with *no container found*, make sure the app has been started,
    its service name is the same, and you are in the folder in which the `docker-compose.yml` 
    file has been saved.

PhotoPrism's command-line interface is well suited for job automation using a
[scheduler](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/scheduler/).

    `docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index -f` rescans all originals, including already indexed and unchanged files. 
    This may be necessary after major upgrades.

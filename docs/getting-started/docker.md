# Running PhotoPrism with Docker

We recommend using [Docker Compose](docker-compose.md) as it is easier to start with for beginners,
and provides more comfort than the pure Docker command-line interface.

### Step 1: Start the server ###

=== "Linux"

    Open a terminal and run this command after replacing `~/Pictures` with
    the folder containing your pictures:
    
    ```
    docker run -d \
      --name photoprism \
      --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
      --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
      -p 2342:2342 \
      -e PHOTOPRISM_UPLOAD_NSFW="true" \
      -e PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD="insecure" \
      -v /photoprism/storage \
      -v ~/Pictures:/photoprism/originals \
      photoprism/photoprism
    ```

    The command may have to be prefixed with `sudo` when not running as root.
    Note that this will point the home directory placeholder `~` to `/root` in volume mounts.
    Kernel security modules such as AppArmor and SELinux have been reported to cause
    [issues](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/faq/#why-is-photoprism-getting-stuck-in-a-restart-loop).

!!! danger ""
    Always change `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` so that PhotoPrism starts with a **secure initial password**.
    Never use easy-to-guess passwords or default values like `insecure` on publicly accessible servers.
    For security reasons, there also is no default in case no password was provided.
    A minimum length of 4 characters is required.

When the app container has been started, open the Web UI by navigating to http://localhost:2342/. 
You should see a login screen.

Sign in with the user `admin` and the password configured via `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
You may change it on the [account settings page](../user-guide/settings/account.md).
Enabling [public mode](config-options.md) will disable authentication.

!!! hint ""
    If you can't connect, try starting the server without `-d`. This keeps it in the foreground
    and shows log messages for troubleshooting. You're welcome to ask for help in our [community chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community).
    Should the server already be running, or you see no errors, you may have started it 
    on a different host and/or port. There could also be an issue with your browser, 
    ad blocker, or firewall settings.

!!! note ""
    For security reasons, it is **not possible to change the password** via `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` 
    after the app has been started for the first time. You may run `docker exec -ti photoprism photoprism passwd`
    in a terminal to change an existing password. You can also reset your database for a clean start. 

The server port and [config options](config-options.md) may be changed as needed. Remember to restart 
the app container for changes to take effect.

#### Volumes ####

##### /photoprism/originals #####

The *originals* folder contains your original photo and video files.

They are mounted from `~/Pictures` in the example above, where `~` is a placeholder for 
your [home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).

All folders accessible from the host [may be mounted](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/), 
including network drives. Since PhotoPrism is running inside a container, it won't be able to see 
folders that have not been mounted. That's an important security feature.

Multiple folders can be made accessible by mounting them as subfolders:

```
-v ~/Example:/photoprism/originals/Example
``` 

##### /photoprism/import #####

You may optionally mount an *import* folder from which files can be transferred to the *originals* folder
in a structured way that avoids duplicates. Imported files receive a canonical filename and will be 
organized by year and month.

!!! note ""
    You can safely skip this. Adding files via [Web Upload](../user-guide/library/upload.md)
    and [WebDAV](../user-guide/sync/webdav.md) remains possible, unless [read-only mode](config-options.md)
    is enabled, or the [features have been disabled](../user-guide/settings/general.md).

##### /photoprism/storage #####

Cache, session, thumbnail, and sidecar files will be created in `/photoprism/storage`, which is mounted as 
an [anonymous volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) in our example. You may want to 
mount a specific host directory instead. Never remove the volume completely so that you don't lose 
these files after restarting or upgrading the container.

!!! info "Read-Only Mode"
    Running PhotoPrism in read-only mode disables all features that require write permissions,
    like importing, uploading, renaming, and deleting files.
    You may enable it by adding `-e PHOTOPRISM_READONLY="true"`.
    In addition, you may mount the *originals* folder with `:ro` flag so that Docker
    blocks write operations.

### Step 2: Index your library ###

!!! attention ""
    Ensure there is enough disk space available for creating thumbnails and verify file system permissions
    before starting to index: Files in the *originals* folder must be readable, while the *storage* folder
    including all subdirectories must be readable and writeable.

Open the Web UI, go to *Library* and click *Start* to start indexing your pictures.

While indexing, JPEG sidecar files may be created for originals in other formats such as RAW and HEIF.
This is required for image classification, facial recognition, and for displaying them in a Web browser.
Sidecar and thumbnail files will be added to the *storage* folder, so that your *originals* folder won't be modified.

Your [photos](../user-guide/organize/browse.md) and [videos](../user-guide/organize/video.md) will
successively become visible in search results and other parts of the user interface.
Open the *Logs* tab in *Library* to watch the indexer working.

Of course, you can continue using your favorite tools for processing RAW files, editing metadata,
or importing new shots. Go to *Library* and click *Start* to update the index after files have been
changed, added, or removed. This can also be automated using CLI commands and a [scheduler](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/scheduler/).

Easy, isn't it?

!!! info "Reducing Server Load"
    If you're running out of memory - or other system resources - while indexing, try limiting the
    [number of workers](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/config-options/) by setting
    `PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS` to a reasonably small value (depending on your CPU and expectations).
    Also make sure your server has at least 4 GB of [swap](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/swap-space-linux-systems)
    configured so that indexing doesn't cause restarts when there are memory usage spikes.
    Especially the conversion of RAW images and the transcoding of videos are very demanding.
    As a measure of last resort, you may disable using TensorFlow for image classification and facial recognition.

### Step 3: When you're done... ###

You can stop PhotoPrism and start it again using the following commands:

```
docker stop photoprism
docker start photoprism
```

To remove the container completely:

```
docker rm -f photoprism
```

### Command-Line Interface ###

`photoprism help` lists all commands and config options available in the current version:

```
docker exec -ti photoprism photoprism help
```

Use the `--help` flag to see a detailed command description, for example:

```
docker exec -ti photoprism photoprism backup --help
```

!!! tip ""
    Prefixing commands with `docker exec -ti [container name]` runs them inside an app container.
    If this fails with *no container found*, make sure the app has been started and 
    its container has the same name.

PhotoPrism's command-line interface is well suited for job automation using a
[scheduler](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/scheduler/).

    This may be necessary after major upgrades.

# Scalability, Distributed Computing and Cluster Filesystems 

Obviously this is a home solution. PhotoPrism benefits from fast, local SSD storage
and is explicitly not designed to run on clusters: 
There is no multi-user authentication and no native support for storage APIs like S3.
Our focus was on other features with higher value for private users.

We are [happy to assist](../contact.md) if you need a custom solution that runs well 
in a corporate cloud environment.
